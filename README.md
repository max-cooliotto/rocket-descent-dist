# Rocket Descent (Phaser Prototype)

A lighthearted Phaser.io 2 prototype game originally built as a playful hidden easter egg for a company website, showcasing gameplay, animation, and WebAudio integration.

## Background

This game was originally created in 2018 as a hidden easter egg for a website built during my time working at **RKD Web Studios**.

The title **Rocket Descent** is a playful nod to the company acronym “RKD”.

The game is shared here with permission and is hosted publicly as part of my personal portfolio.

## Audio Note

The voice heard on the splash screen singing:

> “Spaceship game… spaceship game… where are youuu?”

was recorded by my son when he was younger and included as a fun personal touch.

## Technical Notes

- Built using **Phaser.io v2.7.3**
- Designed as a short, self-contained experience
- Includes custom animation and WebAudio handling
- Originally intended as an easter egg rather than a standalone release

## Running the Game

This project is entirely client-side and can be run from any static web server.

> Due to modern browser audio restrictions, sound playback begins only after an initial user interaction.
